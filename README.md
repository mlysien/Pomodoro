- **Theme Switching**: Automatic color scheme changes between work and break modes
- **Smooth Animations**: Fluid transitions and mesh clearing effects
- **Custom Titlebar**: Clean, modern interface with close button

### üîä Sound Features
- **Tick Sound**: A subtle ticking sound plays every second during work and break sessions to help you stay aware of the timer.
- **Break Sound**: A gentle chime plays at the start and end of each short break, and at the end of a long break.

## Releases

### Creating a Release

The app uses GitHub Actions for automated releases. To create a new release:

#### Using the Release Script (Recommended)

**On Windows:**
```bash
scripts\release.bat 1.0.0
```

**On Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/release.sh
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0
```

#### Manual Release Process

1. **Update version numbers:**
   ```bash
   cd pomodoro-tauri
   npm version 1.0.0 --no-git-tag-version
   ```

2. **Update Tauri config version** in `pomodoro-tauri/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`

3. **Create and push a tag:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   git tag -a "v1.0.0" -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

4. **GitHub Actions will automatically:**
   - Build the app for Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Create a GitHub release with all artifacts
   - Generate release notes

### Release Artifacts

Each release includes:
- **Windows**: `.exe` and `.msi` installers
- **macOS**: `.dmg` installer
- **Linux**: `.AppImage` and `.deb` packages

### Supported Platforms
